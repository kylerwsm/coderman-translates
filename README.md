## Getting Started

First, get a Google API key, with Google Cloud Translate, Google Cloud Vision, and Google Speech-to-Text enabled. In `services/translate.ts`, modify the values of `keyFilename`, to where your Google API key is located on your machine.

After which, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
